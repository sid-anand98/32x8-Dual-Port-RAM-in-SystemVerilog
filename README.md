# 32x8-Dual-Port-RAM
This project is about the functional verification of a 32x8 dual port RAM.

The project was built using SystemVerilog to demonstrate the RAM's operation, wherein a synthesizable design code for the 32x8 design specification of RAM was developed. A SystemVerilog Verification testbench was created by developing the following components: packet, generator, driver, input monitor, design file (DUT), output monitor, and scoreboard.
